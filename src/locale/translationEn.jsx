    about2:"About the company The company was established in February 2005 in the city of Tashkent. Currently, the company has 11 branches in Tashkent. The menu consists mainly of club sandwiches, hot dogs, hamburgers, pita breads and cereals. Our priorities are the freshness and quality of ingredients, a variety of fillings, low prices and attention to guest requests. Many different people order from MaxWay every day. And we are trying to increase both the number of visitors and the number of branches. With every dish we prepare, we refine the details of our unique recipes and seek the perfect balance of price and quality to continue to be your favorite brand. If you suddenly experience bad service from us or poor quality of prepared food, write to us. We welcome positive and negative comments. A guest complaint is a gift that gives us an opportunity to grow.",
